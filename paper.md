# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).
Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but continental scale measurements have not previously been made.

# Motivation
Find out more about this important phenomenon.


# Simuilations
We simulate the way they are transported

#Methodloloyg
We compare out measurements......(Smith et al 2002)
Change to paper

#Results
The Simulations indicate that coagulation is the dominant growth mechanism for these particles.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA ageing process.
Nonetheless quesions remain unanswered, so more funding is required.
